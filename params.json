The scope of the Real-time Web server Log Manager with on-demand Reporting is as Daily Traffic, Hourly Traffic, Referrer, Browser, DLs (Downloads), UAs (User Agents), Accesses, Searches, Search Words, Visitors, Countries, Status Codes and Errors.\r\n\r\nSCOPE\r\n\r\nThe scope of the Real-time Web server Log Analyzer with on-demand Reporting is as follows:\r\n\r\nDaily Traffic - Displays downloads per day.\r\n\r\nHourly Traffic - Displays downloads per hour.\r\n\r\nReferrer - Displays URLs that were active before files were downloaded.\r\n\r\nBrowser - Displays the referring URL when you click on a row in the Referrer report.\r\n\r\nDLs (Downloads) - Displays the number of times that files have been downloaded.\r\n\r\nUAs (User Agents) - Displays the User Agents that are accessing the website. A User Agent is the name of the program that is requesting pages on a web site. Usually User Agents refer to web browsers.\r\n\r\nAccesses - Displays the number of accesses and bytes downloaded by each user.\r\n\r\nSearches - Displays the search queries that users have submitted to search engines.\r\n\r\nSearch Words - Displays words used in searches.\r\n\r\nVisitors - Displays the number of unique visitors to the website.\r\n\r\nCountries - Displays visitors' countries and the number of requests and bytes downloaded.\r\n\r\nStatus Codes - Displays status codes for HTTP requests.\r\n\r\nErrors - Displays error codes for HTTP requests.\r\n\r\n*TECHNOLOGY USED:- *\r\n\r\n• Language:-ASP.NET\r\n\r\n• Back end:-MS-ACCESS\r\n\r\nProposed System\r\n\r\nThe proposed system is aimed to develop a Web Server Log Manager, which parses a log file from a web server (like Apache), and based on the values contained in the log file, derives indicators about who, when and how a web server is visited.\r\n\r\nProblem Definition\r\n\r\nThis project is aimed at to develop a web server log Manager, which can analyze the web server access information. This is useful to maintain the network traffic details in a log file, which derives indicators about who, when and how a web server is visited.\r\n\r\nAdvantages over Existing System\r\n\r\nDaily Traffic - Displays downloads per day.\r\n\r\nHourly Traffic - Displays downloads per hour.\r\n\r\nReferrer - Displays URLs that were active before files were downloaded.\r\n\r\nBrowser - Displays the referring URL when you click on a row in the Referrer report.\r\n\r\nDownloads - Displays the number of times that files have been downloaded.\r\n\r\nUser Agents - Displays the User Agents that are accessing the website. A User Agent is the name of the program that is requesting pages on a web site. Usually User Agents refer to web browsers.\r\n\r\nAccesses - Displays the number of accesses and bytes downloaded by each user.\r\n\r\nSCOPE FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nThe project has a very vast scope in future.Web Server Log Manager, parses a log file from a web server (like Apache), and based on the values contained in the log file, derives indicators about who, when and how a web server is visited. Actually, the log files are parsed and all the reports are generated after that - usually on a scheduled basis. This can put great strain on a computer as the parsing and reporting are done in one go. In this project we use Real-time, on-demand Reporting in which the log files is parsed to a database in the background. A report is only generated when requested. This type of analyzer is usually more suited for many users as it places less strain on a server.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
