      <p>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>Web Server Log Manager is a software developed with on demand Reporting is to maintain the network traffic details in a log file, which derives indicators about who, when and how a web server is visited. The scope of the Real-time Web server Log Manager with on-demand Reporting is as Daily Traffic, Hourly Traffic, Referrer, Browser, DLs (Downloads), UAs (User Agents), Accesses, Searches, Search Words, Visitors, Countries, Status Codes and Errors.</p>

<p>SCOPE</p>

<p>The scope of the Real-time Web server Log Analyzer with on-demand Reporting is as follows:</p>

<p>Daily Traffic - Displays downloads per day.</p>

<p>Hourly Traffic - Displays downloads per hour.</p>

<p>Referrer - Displays URLs that were active before files were downloaded.</p>

<p>Browser - Displays the referring URL when you click on a row in the Referrer report.</p>

<p>DLs (Downloads) - Displays the number of times that files have been downloaded.</p>

<p>UAs (User Agents) - Displays the User Agents that are accessing the website. A User Agent is the name of the program that is requesting pages on a web site. Usually User Agents refer to web browsers.</p>

<p>Accesses - Displays the number of accesses and bytes downloaded by each user.</p>

<p>Searches - Displays the search queries that users have submitted to search engines.</p>

<p>Search Words - Displays words used in searches.</p>

<p>Visitors - Displays the number of unique visitors to the website.</p>

<p>Countries - Displays visitors' countries and the number of requests and bytes downloaded.</p>

<p>Status Codes - Displays status codes for HTTP requests.</p>

<p>Errors - Displays error codes for HTTP requests.</p>

<p>*TECHNOLOGY USED:- *</p>

<p>• Language:-ASP.NET</p>

<p>• Back end:-MS-ACCESS</p>

<p>Proposed System</p>

<p>The proposed system is aimed to develop a Web Server Log Manager, which parses a log file from a web server (like Apache), and based on the values contained in the log file, derives indicators about who, when and how a web server is visited.</p>

<p>Problem Definition</p>

<p>This project is aimed at to develop a web server log Manager, which can analyze the web server access information. This is useful to maintain the network traffic details in a log file, which derives indicators about who, when and how a web server is visited.</p>

<p>Advantages over Existing System</p>

<p>Daily Traffic - Displays downloads per day.</p>

<p>Hourly Traffic - Displays downloads per hour.</p>

<p>Referrer - Displays URLs that were active before files were downloaded.</p>

<p>Browser - Displays the referring URL when you click on a row in the Referrer report.</p>

<p>Downloads - Displays the number of times that files have been downloaded.</p>

<p>User Agents - Displays the User Agents that are accessing the website. A User Agent is the name of the program that is requesting pages on a web site. Usually User Agents refer to web browsers.</p>

<p>Accesses - Displays the number of accesses and bytes downloaded by each user.</p>

<p>SCOPE FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT</p>

<p>The project has a very vast scope in future.Web Server Log Manager, parses a log file from a web server (like Apache), and based on the values contained in the log file, derives indicators about who, when and how a web server is visited. Actually, the log files are parsed and all the reports are generated after that - usually on a scheduled basis. This can put great strain on a computer as the parsing and reporting are done in one go. In this project we use Real-time, on-demand Reporting in which the log files is parsed to a database in the background. A report is only generated when requested. This type of analyzer is usually more suited for many users as it places less strain on a server.</p>
